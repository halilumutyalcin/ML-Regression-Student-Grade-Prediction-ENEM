# Student Grades Prediction (National High School Exam) - 2016

The ENEM is the most important exam in Brazil in which students use their scores to be admitted to a university (*specially Federal- and public- Institutions, which usually require really high scores due to their high academic reputation and quality*). The exam includes subjects such as Portuguese, History, Geography, Math, Physics, Chemistry and Biology and is taken in two days(weekend).

## About me:

I am an electrical engineer turned data scientist who loves leveraging data-driven solutions that make an impact on business and society. My first encounter with data science occurred when I worked as a student researcher at the Applied Computational Intelligence Laboratory (Fluminense Federal University) in which I built Artificial Neural Network models for power forecast.

Thereafter, I won a scholarship that allowed me to study at the University of Toronto in Canada. After this experience, I was given the opportunity to work with electrical projects and project management in a small company in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My third working contract involved tasks related to the project management of two electrical substation construction projects in a multinational company.

Right now, Iâ€™m currently working on projects related to machine learning and data science which includes customer segmentation, sales prediction and plagiarism detection.
